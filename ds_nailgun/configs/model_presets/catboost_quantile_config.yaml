# CatBoost Quantile Regression Model Configuration (q=0.9)

model:
  type: CatBoostRegressor
  library: catboost
  parameters:
    iterations: 500  # Reduced from 1000 for faster training
    depth: 6  # Depth of the tree
    learning_rate: 0.1
    subsample: 0.8  # Sample rate for bagging
    colsample_bylevel: 0.8  # Feature fraction per level
    random_state: 1986
    verbose: 2  # Verbose mode
    # Quantile regression specific parameters
    loss_function: 'Quantile:alpha=0.9'  # Quantile loss with 0.9 quantile level

# Optional hyperparameter tuning configuration
hypertuning:
  method: "halving_random_search"  # Successive halving with random search for efficient large-scale optimization
  n_candidates: 50  # Extensive number of candidates for thorough search
  parameters:
    depth: [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]  # Extended depth range
    learning_rate: [0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]  # Broader learning rate range
    subsample: [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]  # Extended subsample range
    colsample_bylevel: [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]  # Extended feature fraction range
    l2_leaf_reg: [0.1, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20]  # Extended L2 regularization range
    min_data_in_leaf: [1, 5, 10, 20, 50]  # Extended minimum samples per leaf
    border_count: [32, 64, 128, 254]  # Border count for categorical features
    verbose: [2]  # Verbose during tuning
  cv: 3  # Cross-validation folds
  scoring:
    name: 'pinball_loss'
    alpha: 0.9  # Quantile level for pinball loss scoring
  n_jobs: 1  # Halving search doesn't parallelize well
  factor: 3  # Halving factor - eliminate 2/3 of candidates each round
  resource: 'n_samples'  # Resource parameter to optimize (number of training samples)
